# Backend Project Structure

This document outlines the structure of the backend folder for the educational platform project. The backend is organized into several key directories and files, each serving a specific purpose in managing components such as students, teachers, courses, and authentication processes.

## Directory Structure

```
backend
├── src
│   ├── controllers
│   │   ├── studentController.js       // Handles student-related requests (CRUD operations)
│   │   ├── teacherController.js       // Manages teacher-related operations (CRUD operations)
│   │   ├── courseController.js        // Handles course-related requests (CRUD operations)
│   │   ├── authController.js          // Manages user authentication (login, registration)
│   │   └── index.js                   // Aggregates and exports all controllers
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── student.js                  // Defines the student model and schema
│   │   ├── teacher.js                  // Defines the teacher model and schema
│   │   ├── course.js                   // Defines the course model and schema
│   │   └── user.js                     // Defines the user model with common properties
│   ├── routes
│   │   ├── studentRoutes.js            // Defines routes for student operations
│   │   ├── teacherRoutes.js            // Defines routes for teacher operations
│   │   ├── courseRoutes.js             // Defines routes for course operations
│   │   ├── authRoutes.js               // Defines routes for authentication processes

│   │   ├── authMiddleware.js           // Middleware for authentication checks
│   │   └── errorHandler.js             // Middleware for handling errors
│   ├── utils
│   │   └── helpers.js                  // Utility functions for various tasks
│   └── server.js                       // Entry point of the application, sets up the server
├── package.json                        // Configuration file for npm, lists dependencies and scripts
├── .env                                // Contains environment variables for configuration
└── README.md                           // Documentation for the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines
```

## Purpose of Each Component

- **Controllers**: Handle the logic for processing requests and responses related to students, teachers, courses, and authentication.
- **Models**: Define the data structure and methods for interacting with the database for each entity (student, teacher, course, user).
- **Routes**: Define the API endpoints and link them to the appropriate controller functions.
- **Middleware**: Provide additional functionality such as authentication checks and error handling.
- **Utils**: Contain helper functions that can be reused throughout the application.
- **Server**: Initializes the Express server and integrates middleware and routes.

This structure ensures a modular and organized approach to managing the backend components of the educational platform, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.
